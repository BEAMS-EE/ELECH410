\section*{Guidelines}

During the labs, you have seen how to handle inter-task communication, resource sharing, synchronisation, ...
Use this knowledge in a clever way.\\

We ask you to work remotely, you don't need physical access to the device to contribute.
We advise you to use Microsoft Teams as you all already have an account and you can use the Remote Desktop Control feature to compile and run code from a distance.
If for some reason that doesn't suit you, keep in mind that you only need to share the \textit{main.c} file to code.
A simple Pastebin\footnote{\url{https://pastebin.com/}} might do the trick. \\

Start by making a list of all the task that you need.
Then use timing diagrams, block diagrams, state machines or other operating/functional schemes to share your ideas with your team.
