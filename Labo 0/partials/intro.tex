\section*{Organisation}
The course ELEC-H-410 ``Real-Time Systems" has 9 practical work sessions divided into:
\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 introduction lab to the PSoC microcontroller and logic analyzers; 
    \item 2 labs about a real-time OS: \rtos~; 
		\item 4 labs to  realize a project using the concepts previously acquired; 
    \item 2 labs on the CAN bus communications, including an escape game. 
\end{itemize}
You will be using a PSoC 5LP Development kit throughout the course.

\subsection*{Lab kit contents}
Your lab kit should contain the following items: 
\begin{itemize}
		\item A PSoC microcontroller mounted on an extension board, with: 
				\begin{itemize}
						\item a 12-character keyboard; 
						\item a male-USB to female-USB cable; 
				\end{itemize}
		\item a logic analyzer, with: 
				\begin{itemize}
						\item an USB-A to USB-B-Mini cable; 
						\item ten female-to-female cables; 
						\item ten male-to-male pin headers. 
				\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
