\subsection{Basic measurements}
    The red line on the screen is a cursor showing the time and values of signals in the main window. To place a marker (blue line), press space. If you move your cursor, the difference between the marker and the cursor will show in a tooltip.

    The first acquisition must be launched by software. Following acquisitions can be done using the ``go" button of the analyser.
