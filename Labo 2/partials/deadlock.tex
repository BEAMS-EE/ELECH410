\section{Deadlock problem}

Improper use of the mutex (or of any other mechanism of synchronisation between tasks) can bring
to a situation where no task can be executed anymore, this is called a \textit{deadlock} situation.

Open the \kw{Deadlock} project and launch its execution.

{Observe using the logic analyser that no task is executed although the tasks should be periodic.}{}

\E{Find the reason of this deadlock by drawing a time graph of the different calls to the mutexes}{}


\E{
    Fix this problem using the parameter \kw{xTicksToWait} of \kw{xSemaphoreTake()}.
}{}
